# Website Surfer Lite

This is based on my other project, [website-surfer](https://github.com/sadgrlonline/website-surfer). The main difference is that you do not need a complex database to run this! You could simply copy the page onto your static site, replace the URLs in the JavaScript, and run your own 'surfer'.

## How to Use

1. Copy the three files from this repo into a folder on your website. 
2. Edit `script.js` to replace the URLs in the `myURLs` variable.
3. Edit `index.html` to replace the URL in the `<iframe>` element to be your 'starting page'.
4. Style the page how you like, it should be good to go!
